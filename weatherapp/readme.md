I created a simple weather web application that is able to display realtime weather pattern in every city.
In this web application, a user can obtain the temperature, humidity and wind speed of any city in the world. 
HTML CSS and javascript were used tomake this web appplication.
The API used to fetch the real time weather readings were obtained from https://home.openweathermap.org/
